<a href="https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando/releases">Ancient Cave Starring Goemon</a> is a randomizer for <em>Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</em> on the Nintendo 64, created by 
<a href="https://github.com/abyssonym/">abyssonym</a>. It allows you to shuffle door connections, change the 
starting characters from Goemon/Ebisumaru to Sasuke/Yae, and even begin with different items, offering a fresh and 
unpredictable gameplay experience.
</p>

<p>
This Website contains the seeds I have generated and attempted to run. <em>Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</em> is one 
of my favorite N64 games, and this challenge has been a fun way to rediscover its world in new and unexpected ways.
</p>

<p>
If you're a fan of <em>Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</em> and enjoy randomizers, this is a fantastic way to experience 
the game in a new light!
