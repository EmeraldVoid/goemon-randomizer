[Ancient Cave Starring Goemon: Randomizer](https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando/releases/latest/) is a randomizer for *Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon* on the Nintendo 64, created by [abyssonym](https://github.com/abyssonym/). This tool allows you to shuffle door connections, change the starting characters from Goemon/Ebisumaru to Sasuke/Yae, and even start with different items, creating a fresh and unpredictable experience.  

This repository contains the seeds I have generated and attempted to run. *Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon* is one of my favorite N64 games, and this challenge has been a fun way to rediscover its world in new and unexpected ways.
