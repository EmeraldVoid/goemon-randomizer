[Ancient Cave Starring Goemon: Randomizer](https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando/releases/latest/) is a randomizer for *Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon* on the Nintendo 64, created by [abyssonym](https://github.com/abyssonym/). This tool allows you to shuffle door connections, change the starting characters from Goemon/Ebisumaru to Sasuke/Yae, and even start with different items, creating a fresh and unpredictable experience.  

This repository contains the seeds I have generated and attempted to run. *Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon* is one of my favorite N64 games, and this challenge has been a fun way to rediscover its world in new and unexpected ways.  

If you're a fan of *Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon* and enjoy randomizers, this is a great way to bring a new twist to the game!

### A Note from Emerald_Void  
If you're experiencing issues with the randomizer (errors, glitches, crashes, etc.), please report them on the [official randomizer repo](https://github.com/abyssonym/mn64rando/issues). I likely **won’t** be able to assist with technical problems.

# Repo Contents: 

[![Generated Seeds](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generated_Seeds-6E9F18?logo=vitest&logoColor=000000)](https://github.com/EmeraldVoid/goemon-randomizer/releases)

This repo tracks the seeds I've generated and tested. Each seed is labeled as **Working**, **Broken**, or **Unknown**, but statuses may change over time as more testing is done. Check the latest releases for updates.  

- **Working:** Seed functions as expected.  
- **Broken:** Seed is unplayable due to crashes or major issues.  
- **Unknown:** The seed hasn't been fully tested yet.  

⚠ **Note on Seed Generation:** As stated in the documentation, *results may vary between systems even for the same seed.* Your experience may differ from mine.  

I **cannot** share completed seeds (as that would require distributing a ROM), but I can provide my `mn64_settings.yaml` config files.
